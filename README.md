# On Miller-Rabin Primality Test and Its Worst Witnesses

## Abstract
The Miller-Rabin primality test is one of the most well-known 
methods of primality testing used in modern day cryptography. 
Being wildly used due to its speed and simplicity, extensive 
effort has been made to optimize it, with many focused on finding 
its best primality witnesses. Despite such coverage, not much 
research wildly available have focused on its worst witnesses. 
In this paper, I use an algorithmic approach to present some of 
the testâ€™s worst witnesses, hoping to encourage more discussions 
in this topic.
